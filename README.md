# SendSMS

Easy to use Web SMS Application,The application dosn't use a Server Side Language which Exposes the Credentials But we can use any Server side language to
hide the Logic to sending the SMS.

Here in this App i am using Jquery Ajax calls to the Webservice Twilio any Clickatell.
The only Catch is that While using Twilio Free account is we can send sms to only a Single Registered Usr Or while using Clickatell Free Service we 
can send message to anyone but the message body cannot be changed.

I have used both the Clients in this project to give a description to the problem.
